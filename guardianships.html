    <h3>FLORIDA GUARDIANSHIPS</h3>
    <p>
    You always want your loved ones to be able to care for themselves, but when the time comes they are not able to take care of their own physical, emotional and mental, and their finacial well-being, you may wish to discuss the option of guardianships.
    </p>

    <h4>Guardianships for Parents</h4>
    <p>
    You may petition the courts to appoint a guardian over the affairs of your parents or other loved ones, typically when the person's best interests will be served by having someone help them manage their personal affairs. This is particularly valuable when there is no revocable trust, no advance directive, no power or attorney, or no designated health-care surrogate.
    <br>
    <br>
    The courts will appoint a lawyer to make certian the family member's best interests will be represented, and the judge in a guardianship case will always hear the wishes of the person for whom a guardian is being considered. The court will hear all the evidence and reports regarding the individual, or ward, and then make a decision based upon the best interest of that individual.
    </p>

    <h4>Guardianship of Minor Children</h4>
    <p>
    If a parent dies, then usually the suriviving child will live with the surviving parent. But what happens when both parents die, become incapacitated or are declared incompetent? The court may have to intervene in such a case, and the child will then become a ward of the state.
    <br>
    <br>
    If there is no immediate or extended family member willing to take responsibility for the child, the minor ward will likely go into foster care.
    <br>
