  <h3>DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY</h3>

<p>
  A power of attorney is a very important part of your estate planning, as well as planning for those times when you are unable to make decisions or voice your own opinion. In fact, for those who may be appointed a guardian, having a power of attorney in place, in advance, may help you enforce decisions you have already made for yourself.
</p>
<p>
  In Florida, a durable power of attorney will let people know that you have appointed a representative to act on your behalf in the event your are unable to make your own decisions, engage in financial transations, whether personal or business.
